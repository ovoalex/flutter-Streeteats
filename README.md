# flutter_streetfood_delivery_app

A new Flutter project.

Project name: Streeteats

In this project, we will be going through the process of the streeteats app. First you will need to put in the location (address) then you get to choose from the list of delicious food places.
Then add foods to your cart, edit the cart and check out.

Check out screen is the most I got to for this project. When I have more time I will be adding more features to it.

I implemnted the google map and geo location for the future use as well. Since I didnt have enough time I did not get the functions to work. To ge fucnction to work you will need to put in your own API key inside of AndriodManifest.xml 

To access AndriodManifest.xml

flutter-Streeteats/android/app/src/main/

Thank you.


To Run this project you will need Andriod Studio and an Emulator.
